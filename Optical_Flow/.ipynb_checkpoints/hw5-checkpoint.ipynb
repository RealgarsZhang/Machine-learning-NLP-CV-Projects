When we take a window(5 by 5 in the lecture notes) and impose spatial coherence constraint, we will have more equations than the unknowns. It is very likely that this linear system is overdetermined and has no rigorous solution, so we need to solve a least square(LSQ) problem and the solution to LSQ can be computed by multiplying A^T on both size of the equation and take the inverse of A^TA, therefore x = inv(A^TA)*A^T*b. inv(A^TA)*A^T is the pseudo inverse."
